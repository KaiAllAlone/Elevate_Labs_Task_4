Basic Interactive Business Dashboard utilizing KPIs ,Slicers and Visualizations.

This dashboard utilizes Slicers which enables us to categorize the dashboard data based on unique categories and KPI(Key Performance Indicator) whixh shows how effectively an organization is approaching its goal as a quantitative target, if it is moving in the right direction then the organization is approaching its goal positively. E.g Increase in Sales is quantitatively represented by Total Monthly Revenue.

In PowerBI the visuals are linked by default through shared fields and relationships, which lets the value of one say,slicer change the other visual elements.
